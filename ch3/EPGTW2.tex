	\section{Product Structure of Bounded Degree Planar Graphs}
	\subsection{Introduction}
	The usage of product structure theory to study planar graphs has been a very active area of research since Dujmovic et al first showed that planar graphs have bounded queue number using product structure theory \cite{DJMMUW20}. Since then, this result has gone on to lead to improvements in graph colouring\cite{}, adjacency labelling\cite{}, and more. These results have pushed additional interest into the research of product structure theorems for other graph classes and for more specialized ones. In particular, we focus on bounded-degree planar graphs in hopes of improving the product structure theorem for this highly applicable graph class.  
	\subsection{Problem 3}
	Given a planar graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, is it true that $G$ is contained in the product $$H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_c$$ for a graph $H$ with treewidth 3, a path $P$, and the complete graph $K_c$ where $c$ is bounded by some function of $\Delta$?
	
	\subsection{Related Work}
	This problem looks to tighten the bound on $\tw(H)$ to close the bound on the product structure of bounded-degree planar graphs. The problem was initially shown to be true for $\tw(H)=3$ by Dujmovic et al in the same paper that the general planar graph product structure theorem was proven\cite{DJMMUW20}.It was then shown that the case for $\tw(H)=1$ is false\cite{todo}, the proof of which relies on. Tightening this bound would immediately improve results in \cite{}.
